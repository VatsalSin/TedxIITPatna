                <p>
                "Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of values." 
                  Dr Prashant Jha is a true example of that. Being so modest as well as achieving success at the same is one of the many qualities one can take from the man itself.

              <p>
                Dr Prashant always has a urge to keep learning from the surroundings whether it be relating to his field or be it the human values. Besides entrepreneurship, minimalist & innovation only add to his personality.
              </p>

                From being a Physician to being an Engineer and finally being a Professor, his life has been a scheming one with notability successes and helping failures. In short, his life has been invigorating. He is a great Influencer and wants to put India as the leader of medical sciences.

Unlike his peers, he didnâ€™t want to work for a multinational company or go abroad, rather, he wanted to serve the society with a motive of bringing a change. He wanted to bring a positive change in the lives of the people of his home state Bihar. Therefore, soon after he completed his education, he returned to Patna and decided to systematically pursue his dream. He started touring the state to meet the farmers. He realized the sector needs to be more organized. By January 2008, he formed two companies: Kaushalya Foundation, a non-profit, as well as Knids Green Private Limited (KGPL), a commercial entity. From then on, he has reached heights of success. His dreams had started turning into reality. His work wasnâ€™t only appreciated by the society but by nations worldwide. He is an Ashoka Fellow & is included in the list of 25 future heroes of India, published by India Today.
